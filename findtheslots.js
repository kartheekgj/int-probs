//The problem in Gist
//There might be T number of employees in a department and K is the number of the purticualr employee. For D number of days if work allotment happens how many days does the K employee gets the work
//The work allotment happens as defined below
//if we have T employee and K is the number of the purticular employee for D days the allotment happens 
//0->T followed by T->0 followed by 0->T and follows the same pattern until D number of Days
//in the below example of 6Employee with 3rd employee works for 15 days the 3rd employee works on 3rd,10th,15th days of the month respectively.
